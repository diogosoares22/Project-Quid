# Renato's Communication Game Implementation

This project implements a solution to Renato's communication game (see for example https://qid.ethz.ch/hackathon/). On top of that, it also implements a solution to a more general problem where the players are allowed to communicate 2 * k classical bits and are asked to determine the sum modulo 2^k.
